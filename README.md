# Time-Series-and-Forecasting-II
Seasonal ARIMA, dynamic regression model, prophet model, time series neural networks and more.

## Course Objectives
Time Series I and II: 
- Decomposeatime series into its three basic components– trend, seasonality, and remainder; 
- Distinguish between the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions– ACF and PACF;
- Explain the difference between a stationary and non-stationary time series;
- Build the different classes of time series models (Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA) using statistical software;
- Interpret ACF and PACF plots to build autoregressive and moving average models;
- Build ARIMA models using automatic selection techniques;
- Identify the differences between seasonal and non-seasonal data;
- Build seasonal versions of ARIMA models (deterministic vs. stochastic);
- Addexternal variables to ARIMA models to improve modeling performance;
- Build Facebook’s Prophet model and explain the pieces of the Prophet model;
- Addautoregressive terms to a neural network time series model;
- Diagnose different classes of time series models for accuracy and reliability;
- Ensemble many different forecasting models into one;
- Define a hierarchical time series structure for modeling.
